# Mobile Fitness Journal
## Overview: 

The Mobile Fitness Journal is a simple solution to my workout development needs. As someone who thrives on structure, I have found that I am much more productive and consistent when I go to the gym with a planned out workout to follow. The problem then became putting together a plan that was easy to follow, not repetitive and fit my time constraints. 

The Mobile Fitness Journal will provide a solution to this problem by allowing users to select which three general muscle areas they hope to target in the workout, save previous workouts to ensure workouts are not repeated two days in a row and construct workouts that are broken into 15 minute increments. 

## Features:
* **User login:** Users will be able to create accounts and log in to utilize the application. 
* **Workout Creation:** Users will be able to have a workout generated for them once they decide which general muscle area they wish to target and the duration of their workout.
* **Review Previous Workouts:** Users will be able to review previous workouts by utilizing a calendar view. 

## Technologies:
* Python 
* Flask
* MySQL
* SQLAlchemy

## What Iâ€™ll Have To Learn:
To successfully complete this project, I will have to learn how to randomly select exercises for workouts from a database depending on the desired length of the workout concurrently. I will also have to learn how to adapt a modulus into the selection of exercises to ensure workouts are not the same from one day to the next.
